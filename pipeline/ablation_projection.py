"""Projection-granularity ablation (Section 6.4): collapse the command-family
sequence projection (58 symbols) to the function-level projection (tool call
outcome only: ok / err, two symbols), re-run the sequence layer, and compare
what the analyst would receive.

The mini-swe-agent trajectories issue only bash tool calls, so a
function-level projection degenerates to a two-symbol vocabulary; this
ablation quantifies how much diagnostic contrast is lost by not resolving
command families.

Outputs results/ablation_projection.json.
