"""Sequence layer: signature-constrained, threshold-free sequential pattern
mining over the failing pool (Section 4.2), implemented as described in the
EAAI N1 manuscript.

Inputs (05_experiments/data/encoded/):
  sequences_mine.spmf / sequences_mine_succ.spmf   SPMF sequence files
  transactions_mine.txt / transactions_mine_succ.txt  itemset transactions
  itemmap.tsv                                      item id -> string, freq
Output (05_experiments/results/):
  chains.jsonl   one JSON object per delivered chain:
    {items, len, supp_fail, supp_succ, contrast, stage, signature}
  chain_stats.json  delivery curve: stage -> cumulative chains, wall time

Semantics matching the manuscript:
  - symbols restricted to those appearing in delivered signatures (coupling)
  - chains delivered in non-decreasing failing-support order (activation
    schedule): stage n = all chains with support >= freqRank[n]
  - maximality: a chain is delivered only if no supersequence has the same
    failing-pool support (VMSP-style)
  - raw contrast c = supp_fail / (supp_succ + eps)  (kept for traceability)
  - smoothed contrast c' = supp_fail / (supp_succ + 1/n_S)  (add-one over the
    succeeding pool; M4b reviewer fix — bounds c' by n_S and turns the
    degenerate zero-success contrast sf/eps ~ 1e7 into the finite sf*n_S)
  - delivery ranking (M4b): perfect signatures (zero succeeding support) form
    their own group, ordered by failing support; finite-contrast chains are
    ranked by c'. The two groups are never mixed on one scale.
